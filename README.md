# React native app to search for jobs!

This is a react-native application built using Expo-CLI (with a router) and [JSearch](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel), from RapidAPI. I was part of a course provided by [JMastery](https://www.jsmastery.pro/) on youtube, this is not my creation, and it was created to help myself learn how to develop native android and IOS applications using React-Native.

## How to Emulate
If you want to tun this project for yourself to test it's capabilites you can do so by installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
From there, open the project in your prefered IDE, and open a terminal (make sure the terminal is pointing at the project directory).
Then, try installing the Expo-CLI with a router:

```sh
npx create-expo-app@latest -e with-router
```

### On your Phone
Go to your mobile phone's designated app store, and download Expo Go.

### On the terminal again
Run the command below

```sh
npm start
```

Or, if that one fails, run:

```sh
expo-cli start --tunnel
```

Then scan the QR code that appears on your screen using the Expo Go application!

P.s. I know this is a bit complicated, but this application was intended for my use only and no distribution...
