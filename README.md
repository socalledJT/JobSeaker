# React native app to search for jobs!

This is a react-native application built using Expo-CLI (with a router) and [JSearch](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel), from RapidAPI. I was part of a course provided by [JMastery](https://www.jsmastery.pro/) on youtube, this is not my creation, and it was created to help myself learn how to develop native android and IOS applications using React-Native.

I have not provided a way for this app to be ran by anyone else because it was made simply for educational purposes!
